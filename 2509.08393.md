# ABSTRACT

## [1] Context

description of large-scale field topology of protoplanetary disks (PPD),

needs to understand of transport输运 of $B_\mathrm{D, LS}$ inside disk.

## [2] Aims

explore dependencies that stellar magnetic fields $B_\mathrm{S}$ pose on large-scale field $B_\mathrm{D, LS}$ , in **innermost** disk region (=< 0.1 AU).

## [3] Results

large-scale field topology in **stationary** models shows a distinct dependence on specific parameters:

(1) innermost disk region is strongly affected by $P_\mathrm{S,rot}$ and $B_\mathrm{S}$ .

(2) outer disk region is affected by $L_\mathrm{Xray}$ and fossil field.

(3) varying mass flow (through disk) affects $B_\mathrm{D, LS}$ throughout its radial extent.

## [4] Conclusions

the topology of $B_\mathrm{D, LS}$ will affect efficiency of MHD outflows,

such outflows might originate from very inner disk region, dead zone, or outer disk.

## [5] Expectations

will use these models as starting point for conducting long-term evolution simulations of disk and $B_\mathrm{D, LS}$ on scales of ∼ $10^6$ yr,

to investigate combined evolution of disk, magnetic field topology, and resulting MHD outflows.
