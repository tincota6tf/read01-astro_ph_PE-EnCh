# ABSTRACT

### [Q1] what is brown dwarf desert?

the notable shortage=lack=paucity=dearth=scarcity of brown dwarf companions at orbital separations between 0.1 and 5 AU.

### [Q2] what is KS test?

Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test,

compares two Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) (sample A VS sample B, OR sampled VS theoretical) with KS statistic=统计量 

$$D = \mathrm{max}\\{F_1(x)-F_2(x)\\}\ ,$$

**TO JUDGE** whether they are from identitical distributions.

### [Q3] what mechanisms does this paper review, and what about their evaluation results?

(A) disk migration with stellar infall (27 parameters, D = 0.100, p-value = 0.216),

(B) core accretion with mass-dependent survival probability (9 parameters, D = 0.173, p-value = 0.005), 

(C) formation bias through dynamical migration (3 parameters, D = 0.417, p-value = $3.5×10^{-17}$ ).

>use grid-search analysis (parameter-space scanning).
>
>all three mechanisms have their own model and parameter-dependence.

### [Q4] what conclusions does this paper offer?

it suggests that brown dwarfs primarily form at wide separations and undergo limited inward migration,

challenging scenarios that invoke in-situ formation through core accretion processes at close orbital separations.
